# ðŸš§ OpenNEURO for MATLAB ðŸš§
(Under construction) 

A MATLABÂ® toolbox for accessing remote datasets stored on [OpenNEURO](https://openneuro.org/search) data archive. OpenNEURO only stores [BIDS](https://bids.neuroimaging.io)-compliant datasets, so [OpenNEURO for MATLAB](https://github.com/MATLAB-Community-Toolboxes-at-INCF/openneuro-matlab) is also BIDS-aware.
